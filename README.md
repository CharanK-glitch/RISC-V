# RISC-V
This repository contains the design and implementation of a RISC-V CVA6 processor using hardware description languages such as Verilog, VHDL, and Chisel. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of modern chip design principles while leveraging the capabilities of the RISC-V architecture.
